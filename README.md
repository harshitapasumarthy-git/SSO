# SSO
This repository contains a Single Sign-On (SSO) application developed using Java Spring Boot, MySQL database, and Freemarker for the user interface.

Introduction
This project is an implementation of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system that allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications without having to log in again for each one. It uses Java Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL as the database, and Freemarker as the templating engine for the user interface.
